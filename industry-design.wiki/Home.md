## Electronic Hot-and Cold Game 

Our project consists of two components: a tracker, and a tag. Together, these devices facilitate an electronic version of the classic “Hot and Cold” game. Minimally, two people are required to play. The designated “hider” starts the game by placing the tag in an unknown location within one hundred feet of the seeker(s). The objective of the game is then for the seeker(s) to determine the location of the hidden tag using visual and auditory feedback from the tracker within five minutes. If there is more than one seeker, then the first seeker to find the tag wins the game. Additional game modes may be included, such as a race mode and a timed mode.
